# Welcome
This repo will contain ETL, QA and analytical scripts, workbooks and apps consuming
SCB data from legacy database snapshots kept on [data.dpaw.wa.gov.au](https://data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/organization/species-and-communities)
and later the SCB API.

Tasks are tracked at [scarab](https://github.com/parksandwildlife/scarab/issues)
with a neat [Kanban board](https://waffle.io/parksandwildlife/scarab/).
Contact Florian to gain write access.
