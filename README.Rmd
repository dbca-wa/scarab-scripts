# Welcome
This repo contains ETL, QA and analytical scripts, workbooks and apps consuming
SCB data from legacy database snapshots kept on 
[data.dpaw.wa.gov.au](https://data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/organization/species-and-communities)
and later the SCB API.

Tasks are tracked at [scarab](https://github.com/parksandwildlife/scarab/issues)
with a neat [Kanban board](https://waffle.io/parksandwildlife/scarab/).
Contact Florian to gain write access.

# Content
Three workbooks prefixed with "data_etl_" run data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from snapshots of the three original TSC databases on DBCA's CKAN data catalogue into
CSV extracts of cleaned and renamed data. Running each one re-runs the ETL from the snapshots to the extracts.

"Data ETL WACensus" loads a staging copy of WACensus (published as a few layers in KMI's GeoServer) into TSC's API. Subsequently, TSC's function "update taxa" re-builds the taxonomic tree from the WACensus staging copy.

"Conservation status" explores the commonalities and differences in CS handling between
the three original TSC databases.
